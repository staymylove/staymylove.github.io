Welcome to [Zeju Li (李泽钜)](https:/staymylove.github.io/) 's homepage!

I'm a PhD student in The Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, supervised by Prof.Qiang Xu. 

Before that, I got my bachelor's degree in 'class for talent' of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) with honor. I also have some wonderful research experiences in Institute of Automation and Institute of Computing Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Shuyuan Research Center, Nanjing EDA Research Center, BUPT, KAUST, CUHKSZ and CUHK.

My research interests include LLM reasoning, Code-LLM, 3D-LLM and Multimodality. 

<!--Here is my latest [curriculum vitae](https://staymylove.github.io/cv/). -->

**I am actively looking for academic collaboration, feel free to drop me an email. (lizeju0727@gmail.com, wechat: 18743403848)**



<!-- I am in the National Engineering Research Center of Mobile Network Security in BUPT as a research intern, supervised by [Prof. Guoshun Nan (南国顺)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uSykWkMAAAAJ&hl=en). -->


<!-- Before starting my Ph.D. career, I was a research intern at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/), supervised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/) and collaborate with Baidu Talent Intelligence Center, supervised by [Dr. Hengshu Zhu](https://www.zhuhengshu.com/). Moreover, I was a research intern at DKI Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) supervised by [Dr. Shizhao Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E8%AF%97%E6%98%AD-%E5%AD%99-771b42141/), and a research assistant at [HIT-DBLab](http://db.hit.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Hongzhi Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wang). I also did research with [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia) and [Dr. Yu Rong](https://hk.linkedin.com/in/royrong). -->
